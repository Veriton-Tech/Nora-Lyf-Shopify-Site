Section wrapper for cart-drawer
This file exists so that AJAX requests like `?section_id=cart-drawer` return
the expected HTML block. The theme previously provided cart-drawer as a
snippet only, which causes the dev server to 404 when asked for that section.
This wrapper simply renders the `snippets/cart-drawer.liquid` inside a
shopify-section container so clients can safely request the section.

<div id="shopify-section-cart-drawer" class="shopify-section">
  {% render 'cart-drawer' %}
</div>
