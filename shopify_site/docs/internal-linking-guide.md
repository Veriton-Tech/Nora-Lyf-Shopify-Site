# Internal Linking System Documentation

This system provides automated and manual internal linking from blog posts to relevant products and collections, helping to improve SEO, user engagement, and drive sales from content.

## Features

### 1. Automatic Related Links
- **Smart Product Matching**: Automatically finds products related to article tags and content
- **Collection Discovery**: Identifies relevant collections based on article topics

- **Contextual Integration**: Links blend naturally with article content

## Usage

### Automatic Implementation
The system is already integrated into your article template. Related products and collections will automatically appear at the bottom of blog posts based on:

- **Article Tags**: Products/collections with matching tags
- **Content Keywords**: Products mentioned in article text
- **Fallback Options**: Featured products if no matches found

### Manual Inline Links

#### In Article Content (HTML Mode)
Add these snippets directly in your blog post HTML:

**Link to a Specific Product:**
```liquid
{% render 'inline-content-link', type: 'product', handle: 'your-product-handle', text: 'Shop this product' %}
```

**Link to a Collection:**
```liquid
{% render 'inline-content-link', type: 'collection', handle: 'your-collection-handle', text: 'Browse the collection' %}
```

#### Examples

**Product Link Example:**
```liquid
{% render 'inline-content-link', 
   type: 'product', 
   handle: 'organic-protein-powder', 
   text: 'Try our bestselling protein' %}
```

**Collection Link Example:**
```liquid
{% render 'inline-content-link', 
   type: 'collection', 
   handle: 'workout-supplements', 
   text: 'Explore workout supplements' %}
```

## Content Strategy Tips

### 1. Tag Optimization
- **Use Relevant Tags**: Tag articles with product categories, ingredients, or use cases
- **Match Product Tags**: Ensure products have similar tags to articles

### 2. Content Integration
- **Natural Mentions**: Mention product names naturally in article content
- **Problem-Solution**: Present products as solutions to problems discussed
- **Educational First**: Focus on education, then introduce relevant products

### 3. Strategic Placement
- **Mid-Article**: Place inline links where they add value to the content
- **Contextual**: Link products when they're naturally relevant to the discussion
- **Call-to-Action**: Use action-oriented link text
