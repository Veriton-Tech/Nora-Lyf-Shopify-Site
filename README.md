## Technical Implementation

### Liquid Templates

[Templates](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/templates#template-types) control what's rendered on each type of page in a theme.

The Nora Lyf theme uses [JSON templates](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/templates/json-templates) to make it easy for merchants to customize their health and wellness store.

Custom templates include:
- Product pages optimized for supplement information
- Collection pages with health category filtering
- Contact forms with health consultation options
- About pages highlighting medical disclaimers

### Custom Sections

[Sections](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/sections) are Liquid files that allow you to create reusable modules of content that can be customized by merchants.

Nora Lyf-specific sections include health-focused schema settings for:
- Product dosage information
- Health concern categorization
- Brand authenticity verification
- Medical disclaimer content
- Customer testimonial management

For more information, refer to the [section schema documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/sections/section-schema).

### Component Blocks

[Blocks](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/blocks) let developers create flexible layouts by breaking down sections into smaller, reusable pieces of Liquid.

Nora Lyf blocks are designed for health and wellness content:
- Health benefit highlights
- Ingredient information cards
- Usage instruction blocks
- Safety warning displays
- Brand showcase elements

For more information, refer to the [block schema documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/blocks/theme-blocks/schema).

## Schema Configuration

When developing health and wellness components, we recommend these guidelines:

- **Health Product Settings**: Use schema for supplement information:

    Recommended Dosage: {{ product.metafields.health.dosage }}
  </div>

  {% schema %}
  {
    "settings": [{
      "type": "text",
      "label": "Dosage Information",
      "id": "dosage",
      "info": "Daily recommended dosage"
    }]
  }
  {% endschema %}
  ```

- **Health Category Settings**: For category-based layouts:

  ```liquid
  <div class="health-category {{ section.settings.health_focus }}">
    ...
  </div>

  {% schema %}
  {
    "settings": [{
      "type": "select",
      "id": "health_focus",
      "label": "Health Focus",
      "options": [
        { "value": "immunity", "label": "Immune Support" },
        { "value": "energy", "label": "Energy & Vitality" },
        { "value": "digestive", "label": "Digestive Health" }
      ]
    }]
  }
  {% endschema %}
  ```
